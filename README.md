### Introduction

In this repository we explore the resources of convolutional neural networks (CNN) to develop a classification model for images containing handwritten symbols using Python and TensorFlow.

The aim is not to review completely the topic, but give some basis to understand and start work with it. Explanation of concepts and logic is provided, but there is no detailed explanation about the code, some Phyton and arrays knowledge is required to follow it.
